# Interface Segregation Principle

It states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. In other words, it's better to have many smaller, specific interfaces rather than a few large, general-purpose ones.

By following ISP, we create a more modular and flexible design that's easier to maintain and extend. Each client can implement only the interfaces it needs, leading to a cleaner and more intuitive API.
