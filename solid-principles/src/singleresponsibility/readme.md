# Single Responsibility Principle

It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should only have one job or responsibility. 

Adhering to SRP makes your code more maintainable and understandable.

## Key Points of SRP

**Single Responsibility:** Each class should have only one reason to change.

**Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of functionality should be separated into different classes.

**Maintainability:** Changes in one area should not affect other areas of the code.
