# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

It states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality of the program. 

In other words, a subclass should be able to stand in for its superclass without the client knowing the difference.

## Key Points of LSP

**Substitutability:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

**Behavior Preservation:** Subtypes must preserve the behavior expected by the clients of the base types.

**Interface Consistency:** Subtypes should conform to the interface of their base types without modifying the expected behavior.
